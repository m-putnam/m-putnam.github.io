			<h3>Quick rundown</h3>
			<p>
			I am a recent graduate of Keene State College
			(B.S.  Computer Science) seeking entry-level
			work in the software industry.  I have
			experience primarily in Java and C#, as well as
			with SQL, both through MySQL and Oracle DB.
			I’ve completed projects for Windows, Linux/BSD,
			and Android, as well as some web applications
			using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP.  I’ve
			also found uses for Microsoft Excel and VB
			macros in the workplace, in order to streamline
			data validation tasks while ensuring
			correctness.
			</p>
			<p>
			I also have a background with mathematics,
			although it stops short of an official minor.  I
			have taken Calculus 1 &amp; 2, linear algebra,
			and discrete mathematics; I’ve found it a very
			worthwile addition to a standard programming
			curriculum.
			</p>
			<p>
			I exist in digital form on both <a
				href="https://github.com/m-putnam">GitHub</a>
			and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lavin-35633b199/">LinkedIn</a>.
			You can also view <a href="https://github.com/m-putnam/m-putnam.github.io">

					program according to a starting
					specification.
				</li>
				<li>
					Digital Image Processing:  An
					introduction to digital image
					processing through MATLAB, which
					culminated in a final project to
					identify lane markers in road
					images.

					An introduction to developing
					Android-based mobile apps, as

			<h3>WxApp</h3>
			<p>
			Consider <a href="https://github.com/m-putnam/LavinM_WxApp">WxApp</a>,
			a C#/.NET 6 app which uses WinForms and the
			Windows Runtime geolocation API to retrieve and
			display a weather forecast from the National
			Weather Service web API, much as this website
			gives the current conditions in Keene, New
			Hampshire.

			In this assignment, I encountered plenty of need
			for creativity:  I had to learn from square one
			the role of radicals in Mandarin Chinese
			(they’re the building blocks of every single
			character, and convey meaning themselves), and
			conduct research both online and in print
			sources to determine the meaning and usage of
			each radical.
